## What is this repo for?
This repo is created to help record working solutions to 
problems on Codewars written in the C programming language.

## Why solutions in C?
Personal preference. I think C code has a certain appeal to it. It also
is the grandfather programming language, so buy learning it, it will help in 
creating a strong foundation in Computer Science.

## What is a *"kyu"*?
Kyu or rank/level translated from Japanese, dictates the difficulty of the 
propelms. The ranking goes from *kyu 8*, the easiest level to *kyu 1*, the 
most challenging. Please check the corresponding directory for the solution 
to the desired challenge.
